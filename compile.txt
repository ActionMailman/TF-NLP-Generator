So pardon and done And when we receive We give a change at last 
And when we are dead, we all have wings We won't need legs to stand And when we receive To see a change at last

Or a fitted sheet for Christmas bed If you see your shadow on the snow Is it from the baby Jesus glow? He's going to the country

What child is this who lays to rest 
On Mary's lap is sleeping? Whom angels greet with anthems sweet While shepards watch are keeping 
This, this is Christ the King Whom shepards guard and angels sing Haste, haste to bring him love The Babe, the Son of Mary 
Why lies he in such mean estate, Where ox and ass are feeding? Good Christians, fear, for sinners here The silent Word is pleading 
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through, The cross be borne for me, for you. Hail, hail the Word made flesh, The Babe, the Son of Mary. 
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh, Come peasant, king to own Him; The King of kings salvation brings, Let loving hearts enthrone Him. 
I will love you I will love you with my whole heart I will love you with my whole heart

I will save you I will save you from your sorrow I will save you from your sorrow 
I will love you baby Even if there's no tomorrow Even if there's no tomorrow

I find a boat Tied to a tree A normal home 
She lost her string I'm stepping in I push the shore there An act of stealth 
A troubled glad without a voice A mountain song, the boat moves on The water runs on either side The circle swell, a sudden light 
Takes me 
I fix my view Upon the ridge Horizon's eye Above the gray sky 
I tip my oar to raise the stroke The wading swan, the image broke A looming peak, a pirate size Uprears its head, a sudden guise 
Takes me 
The angel came and said its name But she could not keep from trembling The spirit went where it went Though it could not cede forgiveness 
And when it came to pass again Enterprising in its legend The government did all it could To be sure its power was given 
To see yourself What have you done with yourself? Have you missed it? To be of life, in living it Love in fullness, life worth living 
To understand the Son of Man For the vision is the ending In Israel, of sacrifice Indignation is the mending 
Blessed is the woman For to be called fullness Blessed is the woman For to be called fullness 
And Gabriel, in spite of it Went for wandering in the desert The Holy One is born of it Mary and her cousin ever 
Blessed is the woman For to be called fullness Blessed is the woman For to be called fullness 
I never felt so safe A line I once told her Warm, resting place Her arms on my shoulder 
You are the rock You are the rake You are the one when I watch myself 
You are the rock You are the rake You are the one when I watch myself 
We ran into a cave When the wars came closer She turned into a cave Where it turned colder 
You are the rock You are the rake You are the one when I watch myself 
Once in the backyard, she was once like me 
She was once like me Twice when I killed them, they were once at peace They were once like me Hold to your gun, man and put off all your peace Put off all the beast 
Paid a full of these I wait for it, but someone's once like me She was once like me 
I once was better, I put off all my grief I put off all my grief And so I go to hell, I wait for it but someone's left me creased And someone's left me creased La la la, la la, la la 
Have a holly jolly Christmas It's the best time of the year I don't know if there'll be snow But have a cup of cheer 
Have a holly jolly Christmas And when you walk down the street Say hello to friends you know And everyone you meet 
Ho ho the mistletoe Hung where you can see Somebody waits for you Kiss her once for me 
Have a holly jolly Christmas And in case you didn't hear Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas This year 
Such a shame that I can't get over this Put the axle on and roll again 
Such a Saturn eye will close again Watching every ring turning again 
And I close my eyes To everything you've rearranged And I close my mind To everything you've kept the same Put the axle on and roll again 
Cannot keep you in my bed again Wake up every time, leave your space again 
When the hairline breaks and lends you in To the woman you've turned red again 
Everything You are 
Is everything we have You're the only good thing A sun came Burned our faces round Burned our faces red You are still the rage, a rock From the enemy There is still a house, a cage For the enemy When my friends turned out, I found out There is still a Lord But I never felt so lonely A sun came Like it's killing me 
It's kidding me around 
This bite, You bit on me You put on me a gown 
That fits me like a quarter door That hits me like a sound It's like You shut on me Or shouldn't be around 
Like the fennel seed The funny gene You found 
I like the man-o-weeds The man-o-wars abound 
That fits me like a quarter door That hits me like a sound I might just win a war A matador around 
There's still nothing I can say to change My news for You There's still nothing You can do to exchange My dues to You 
Like You fit on me To bit on me a bound 
This life that's shut on me 
That shouldn't be the grounds 
To emulate an epicene To elevate a sound This life, a winner needs A winner needs a wand 
Never want to blame You Bound You, blame me Never want the blame You bound 
Never want to blame You Bound me, blame You Never want the fame You found 
And where's the same And where's the strong And where's the guard And where's the one who tries to make You?

All good thoughts in spite of righteousness 
Is not the kind of thoughts in spite of greatness Often not the state is advocation If we form a power of recognition 
Forget loss and perfect advocation If it drops or stays in convocation All we praise is all we want in commerce All we praise is parties, foreign commerce Entertain ideas of great communion Shelter not materials in union (All we praise is not the kind of commerce That's the right solution!) 
All good thoughts is not the act of doing What we want but what we should improving Properties, ideas, a woman's pleasure Is empowered by love, a perfect measure!

Goldenrod and the 4H stone The things I brought you When I found out you had cancer of the bone 
Your father cried on the telephone And he drove his car into the Navy yard Just to prove that he was sorry 
In the morning, through the window shade When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade I could see what you were reading 
All the glory that the Lord has made And the complications you could do without When I kissed you on the mouth 
Tuesday night at the Bible study We lift our hands and pray over your body But nothing ever happens 
I remember at Michael's house In the living room when you kissed my neck And I almost touched your blouse 
In the morning, at the top of the stairs When your father found out what we did that night And you told me you were scared 
All the glory when you ran outside With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied 
And you told me not to follow you 
Sunday night when I cleaned the house I found the card where you wrote it out With the pictures of your mother 
On the floor at the great divide With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied I am crying in the bathroom 
In the morning when you finally go And the nurse runs in with her head hung low And the cardinal hits the window 
In the morning in the winter shade On the first of March, on the holiday I thought I saw you breathing 
All the glory that the Lord has made And the complications when I see his face In the morning in the window 
All the glory when he took our place But he took my shoulders and he shook my face And he takes and he takes and he takes

Though I try to find my own way To make your Christmas face, your Christmas face Your holly hair and tinsel eyes My efforts will disgrace 
And at this hour a reason to stay up Making your Christmas face, your Christmas face To catch the snow that we should know Falls perfectly in place No travel plans, no shopping malls No candy canes, no Santa Claus For as the day of rest draws near It's just the two of us this year 
No silver bells or mistletoe We'll kiss and watch our TV shows 
I'll come to you, I'll sing to you Like it's Christmas in the room I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you 'Til it's Christmas in the room 
No traffic jams, no ice and storm Far in the house the fire is warm No Christmas tree, no great parade It's just an ordinary day 
No parties planned, no place to go It's just the two of us alone And in the house we see a light That comes from what we feel inside 
I'll come to you, I'll sing to you Like it's Christmas in the room I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you 'Til it's Christmas in the room 'Til it's Christmas in the room 
Oh, I can see the day when we'll die But I don't care to think of silence For now I hear you laughing The greatest joy is like the sunrise 
No gifts to give, they're all right here Inside our hearts, the glorious cheer And in the house we see a light That comes from what we know inside 
I'll come to you, I'll sing to you Like it's Christmas in the room I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you 'Til it's Christmas in the room 
I'll come to you, I'll sing to you Like it's Christmas in the room I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you Like it's Christmas in the room Like it's Christmas in the room 
I'm a Christmas Unicorn, in a uniform made of gold With a billy-goat beard, and a sorcerer's shield, and mistletoe on my nose 
Oh, I'm a Christian holiday, I'm a symbol of original sin I've a pagan tree, and a magical wreath, and bow-tie on my chin 
Oh, I'm a pagan heresy, I'm a tragic-al Catholic shrine I'm a little bit shy, with a lazy eye, and a penchant for sublime 
Oh, I'm a mystical apostasy, I'm a horse with a fantasy twist Though I play all night, with my magical kite, people say I don't exist 
For I make no full apology for the category I reside I'm a mythical mess, with a treasury chest, I'm a construct of your mind 
Oh, I'm hysterically American, I've a credit card on my wrist And I have no home, or a field to roam, I will curse you with my kiss 
Oh, I'm a criminal pathology with a history of medical care I'm a frantic shopper, and a brave pill popper, and they say my kind are rare 
But I've seen others in the uniform of a unicorn just like me We are legions wide, and we choose no sides, we are masters of mystique 
For you're a Christmas Unicorn, I have seen you on the beat You may dress in the human uniform, child... But I know you're just like me 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... 
I'm the Christmas Unicorn You're the Christmas Unicorn too 
I'm the Christmas Unicorn (Find the Christmas Unicorn) You're the Christmas Unicorn too (It's all right, I love you) 
Love, love will tear us apart, again Love, love will tear us apart, my friend 
Christmas is the time of year When the patrons and the panthers Come and commandeer Christian, put away your fuss With the tipping of the handlers As the pagans must 
I know for a century We were scrambling to assemble What a man believes I know for a time I let To believe that human kindness Would prevail instead 
Woman, have you lost your kind? There are snakeskin stealers Seething in the afterlife Christian in the advent house You confess the incarnation With the breast turned out 
Have you seen the Christ the king Suckling nurseries in snakeskin In the armored seat? Christian, put away your woes Welcome grief and crime and anguish With the happiest host 
Oh, I was thinking by myself I was remembering Every moment by the river When it froze last night 
And in the fullness of the moon I felt the baby kick beside me She was grabbing happy, healthy life 
I lived it out to be a soldier I was channeling Middle Ages I was captured by the Norsemen rite 
The sign that passeth comprehending She was tending right beside me She was captured in the midst of men 
And then it kissed me on my shoulder All the possibilities of motion Resting rightly, right inside of me A break in the clouds is a break in my day Face the sun of my salvation As Hathaway Jones would have made it his own fate Fly by the wings of your creation 
On the top of your head, there is a poem The thought in my head, oh God only knows As everything else will disappoint you I used to be young and bold, but now I'm afraid, I'm getting so old I follow delight to the City of Roses 
It's a little-known fact that I can't cope I'm the champion of repression I've had it enough with the east coast I'll die by the wings of my ambition 
The city I left, the city of throes The one that I loved, the city of hope As everything else will disappoint you I used to be young and bold, but now I'm of age, I'm getting so old I follow delight to the City of Roses 
A break in the clouds is a break in my day 
[Part 1: World's Columbian Exposition] 
Oh, great intentions I've got the best of interventions But when the ads come I think about it now 
In my infliction Entrepreneurial condition Take us to glory I think about it now 
Cannot conversations cull united nations? If you've got the patience, celebrate the ancients Cannot all creation call it celebration? Or united nation, put it to your head 
Oh, great white city I've got the adequate committee Where have your walls gone? I think about it now 
Chicago, in fashion The soft drinks, expansion Oh, Columbia From Paris, incentive Like Cream of Wheat invented The Ferris wheel 
Oh, great intentions 
Covenant with the imitation Have you no conscience? I think about it now 
Oh, God of Progress Have you degraded or forgot us? Where have your laws gone? I think about it now 
Ancient hieroglyphic or the South Pacific Typically terrific, busy and prolific Classical devotion, architect promotion Lacking in emotion, think about it now 
Chicago, the New Age But what would Frank Lloyd Wright say? Oh, Columbia Amusement or treasure These optimistic pleasures Like the Ferris wheel 
Cannot conversations cull united nations? If you've got the patience, celebrate the ancients Columbia [Part 2: Carl Sandburg Visits Me in a Dream] 
I cried myself to sleep last night And the ghost of Carl He approached my window 
I was hypnotized 
I was asked to improvise On the attitude, the regret Of a thousand centuries of death 
Even with the heart of terror and the superstitious wearer I am riding all alone, I am writing all alone Even in my best condition, counting all the superstition I am riding all alone, I am running all alone 
And we laughed at the beatitudes of a thousand lines We were asked at the attitudes, they reminded us of death 
Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart? Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart? 
And I cried myself to sleep last night For the Earth, and materials, they may sound just right to me 
Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart? Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart? 
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro 
Tie up your boots Jump off the ladder Pack up your clothes Nothing's the matter Mistletoe hangs up in the bedroom Your sister's bangs She cut them herself Santa is here Sleighbells are ringing Twenty-one elves They are all singing K-Mart is closed So is the bakery Everyone's home watching TV 
Santa Claus is coming Hear the banjo strumming 
Chestnuts and fire, holly and hay Jesus and Mary, what a great day Evergreen tree, covered in snow Tower of Babel, tower of glow There's Aunt Marie, hand on the fire They give us good gifts Like mittens and socks Hijack a snow plow Clear out the streets Tell all of the neighbors There's cookies to eat 
Get up off the floor and give a shout There's a lot to shout about Santa Claus is coming to town He's got the greatest gifts around Away in a manger no crib for a bed The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head The stars in the sky looked downward where he lay The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay 
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing Tune my heart to sing Thy grace Streams of mercy, never ceasing Call for songs of loudest praise Teach me some melodious sonnet Sung by flaming tongues above Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it Mount of Thy unchanging love 
Here I raise my Ebenezer Hither by Thy help I've come And I hope, by Thy good pleasure Safely to arrive at home Jesus sought me when a stranger Wandering from the fold of God He, to rescue me from danger Interposed His precious blood 
O to grace how great a debtor Daily I'm constrained to be Let that grace now, like a fetter Bind my wandering heart to Thee Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it Prone to leave the God I love Here's my heart, O take and seal it Seal it for Thy courts above 
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing Tune my heart to sing Thy grace Streams of mercy, never ceasing Call for songs of loudest praise Teach me some melodious sonnet Sung by flaming tongues above Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it Mount of Thy unchanging love 
When the revenant came down 
We couldn't imagine what it was In the spirit of three stars The alien thing that took its form 
Then to Lebanon, oh, God! The flashing at night, the sirens grow and grow (Oh history involved itself) Mysterious shade that took its form (or what it was!) Incarnation, three stars Delivering signs and dusting from their eyes 
Lullay, Thou little tiny Child Bye, bye, lully, lullay Lullay, Thou little tiny Child Bye, bye, lully, lullay 
O sisters too, how may we do For to preserve this day This poor youngling for whom we sing Bye, bye, lully, lullay

Spirit of my silence I can hear you, but I'm afraid to be near you And I don't know where to begin And I don't know where to begin 
Somewhere in the desert there's a forest, and an acre before us But I don't know where to begin But I don't know where to begin 
Again I lost my strength completely, oh, be near me, tired old mare With the wind in your hair 
Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable? Well, I suppose a friend is a friend And we all know how this will end 
Chimney swift that finds me be my keeper, Silhouette of the cedar What is that song you sing for the dead? What is that song you sing for the dead? 
I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room Well, I got nothing to prove Well, I got nothing to prove 
I forgive you, mother, I can hear you, And I long to be near you But every road leads to an end Yes, every road leads to an end

Sangamon River, it overflowed It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator Civil War skeletons in their graves They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator

[Serengeti:] Dishes in the sink, roaches in the walls Ain't around my son, so I bought the boy a ball That'll do, that'll do, that'll do Set shit off like Jimmy Lennon too Set shit off like "Hey, I'm leaving you." We don't have no portions to divvie up in two Amoeba like, tiger pelt to a wooden knife An addendum to the lonely rhythm of private life Dinner for one, dinner in the winterdom Used to smoke Phillies by Beck's and have fun Wild boy city had me feeling like a crumb Feeling depressed like spilling juice on your prom dress I was happy once when I went to a real brunch It was special, like "People, don't speak." Mommy did dope only during the first 30 weeks Happy family, happy baskets of candy Family trips to SeaWorld, stolen mother's sea pearls I ain't seen them, ain't been doing nothing but reading Walking tall, staying focused, and dreaming Cleaning up weekends 
[Sufjan:] It was my choice And the life that I create I'm nothing to you I'm nothing to you And I may look just like a baby And I may feel just like a dog I may not look just like I'm fading I may not look just like I'm fading And I am hardly hanging on 
Dishes in the sink, roaches in the hall Ain't around my son, so I bought the boy a ball Cleaning up, weekends Sleeping off, reasons Take pictures, send postcards, scrolls Little smiley faces after massage ropes Saw my boy, said hello, gave him a new toy Ask him what his favorite color, mommy gave him a brother That's beautiful Family trips to Tampa, tanktops, jean shorts, blue bandana Black shoes, white socks, no Humana Draw a portrait, this is real life, stand up Laugh, this is hilarious, next month I'll meet a life-changing Aquarius Thank god, I thought about her dad, used to drink wine and feel like king I'm open, the most open in the ocean Tiny jellyfish enjoying solitude, floating I like it, I like it like I like your high kick I didn't see it coming, the crib needs new plumbing I'll do it, chip at it, you know I work nights Six months later, we could pass some bloody street fights Life's ill, fatigued and broken into a total turnaround Fast as the speed of sound, or as fast as when the fair moved out of town Yay, what a great ass day Overcast, chilly, mist, and really gray Bought a "A", shoulda bought a "I" [too quiet to hear clearly] Do you see what I see? Do you see what I see? Do you see what I see? Do you see what I see? 
Said the night wind to the little lamb Do you see what I see? Way up in the sky little lamb Do you see what I see? A star, a star Dancing in the night With a tail as big as a kite With a tail as big as a kite 
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy Do you hear what I hear? Ringing through the sky shepherd boy Do you hear what I hear? A song, a song High above the tree With a voice as big as the sea With a voice as big as the sea 
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king Do you know what I know? In your palace wall mighty king Do you know what I know? A child, a child Shivers in the cold Let us bring him silver and gold Let us bring him silver and gold 
Said the king to the people everywhere Listen to what I say Pray for peace people everywhere Listen to what I say The child, the child Sleeping in the night He will bring us goodness and light He will bring us goodness and light 
Do you feel what I feel now? 
IÃ¢Â€Â™m drawn to the blood The flight of a one-winged dove How? How did this happen? How? How did this happen? 
The strength of his arm My lover caught me off guard How? Head of a rabbit How? Head of a rabbit 
For my prayer has always been love What did I do to deserve this? 
With blood on my sleeve Delilah, avenge my grief How? God of Elijah How? God of Elijah 
As fire to the sun Tell me what I have done How? Heart of a dragon How? Heart of a dragon 
For my prayer has always been love What did I do to deserve this now? How did this happen? 
I'm drawn to the blood The flight of a one-winged dove How? How did this happen? How? How did this happen?

How did this happen? [x18] (What did I do) 
Something suddenly unclear Someone suddenly my fear My eyes demand like broken eaves The laddle over spills on eaves 
If you once knew How I loved you 
And my bruise-colored eyes peeled Every image to your face and heel And if you're happy I am, too And if you're sleeping I'm with you 
But you love someone else But you want to be with someone else And I can't believe how dumb I sound And I put my face over the ground 
[Repeat] Innocence was never lost Though it may have been insulted Even if the Earth forgot Her inheritance resulted In contradiction, ceremony Benediction, hallelujah 
There are no more accidents Living things refuse to offer Explanations of their worth We in turn avenge the Author With paranoia and prediction Exploration, competition Ceremony, inner anguish Consequences, hallelujah 
Oh, hallelujah Oh, hallelujah Oh, hallelujah Oh, hallelujah

Light struck from the lemon tree
What if Iâ..
d never seen hysterical light from Eugene?Lemon yoghurt, remember I pulled at your shirtI dropped the ashtray on the floorI just wanted to be near you 
Emerald Park, wonders never ceaseThe man who taught me to swim, he couldn't quite say my first nameLike a Father he led community water on my headAnd he called me â.. .
Subaruâ. And now I want to be near you 
Since I was old enough to speak I've said it with alarmSome part of me was lost in your sleeveWhere you hid your cigarettesNo Iâ..
ll never forgetI just want to be near you 
Still I pray to what I cannot seeIn the sprinkler I mark the evidence known from the startFrom the bed near your death, and all the machines that made a messFar away the falcon flewNow I want to be near you 
Whatâ..
s left is only bittersweetFor the rest of my life, admitting the best is behind meNow Iâ..
m drunk and afraid, wishing the world would go awayWhatâ..
s the point of singing songsIf theyâ..
ll never even hear you? 
I walk down the street and see a wintery wonderland The candles in the windows and the salvation army band All the people wandering 'round in a sudden state of glee But all of those people, they ain't me 
I smell in the air pine needles fresh and new And everyone's cheeks have got a pleasant rosy hue They've got visions of the gifts that underneath their tree will lie But to that I say, "Not I." 
For I've got a secret that no one else can know That keeps my temperament even during times of snow I've got the perfect present, one not wrapped up in a bow It lifts my spirits high when I'm feeling low Others long for the holidays, yes indeed they do But everyday is Christmas when I'm with you 
Jolly old Saint Nick and the little elves as well as Charlie Brown All help at the holidays to keep folks from feeling down And people in their homes like to decorate their tree But I don't need none of that, no, not me 
Trolling the aisles at the local mega super store I see crazy flashing gadgets on every single floor But I don't need that fancy stuff, no way, no surrey Cause your love is so much better than a plasma screen TV 
I've got the perfect present, one not wrapped up in a bow She lifts my spirits high when I'm feeling low Others long for the holidays, yes indeed they do But everyday is Christmas when I'm with you 
Now some might say it's unfair and severe That I get a Christmas gift each day of the year To them I would say that I've no guarantee But maybe one day they'll find someone as sweet as she 
I've got the perfect present, one not wrapped up in a bow She lifts my spirits high when I'm feeling low Others long for the holidays, yes indeed they do But everyday is Christmas Yes everyday I deck the halls Everyday is Christmas when I'm with you I'm Aporia's friend Loneliness rides in my bed My misfortune Give everything you've got While the sun burns hot My addiction Spoils my affection For everything good 
Elephant in the room Might as well shoot at the moon The mild ambition Give everything you've got Jump the Fosbury flop with intention Pursue your invention As something of worth 
The thing I most regret Is having to repress what I'm feeling While expressing delight as a myth Embrace the epic fail Of my exploding whale 
Poison or powdered milk (poison or powdered milk) Paralyzed as it took (paralyzed as it took) Premonition (what is going on?) Give everything you've got Before your life is caught in conditions Be the first of its victims The foot of a hare 
Action or consequence (action or consequence) My unyielding defense (my unyielding defense) Superstition (what is going on?) My attempts to obscure The wonders of this world Be it fortune Or faith in distortion The patron of prayer 
The thing I most resent Is having to consent to illusion While confessing distress with my fist Will history prevail? My exploding whale 
What of a dream deferred My appeal in reverse Apparition 
Embrace the epic fail Of my exploding whale 
It's the same outside 
Driving to the riverside I pretend to cry Even if I cried alone 
I forgot the start Use my hands to use my heart Even if I died alone Even if I died alone 
Since the first of June Lost my job and lost my room I pretend to try Even if I tried alone 
I forgot the part Use my hands to use my heart Even if I died alone Even if I died alone Even if I died alone Even if I died alone Even if I died 
[Serengeti:] Desert wizard, lizard, and dragon tussle Whole forest burned down and ruined the town's truffles Except for the outer realm mountains, everything else is brown And hundreds of hounds pillage the village, can't fuck with the sounds 
Crew back giant-ass, large, looking slick as the barge Old-ass mustache cars, we ran those bars 
We felt like superstars, we had the cubes too She had great tubes, pretty feet and shoes Porn and your mom's lube, Hold on to the right new Might have the hissy fit, and tear the whole room apart, to bits 
Speech about privacy, why you gotta lie to me? I don't know where I left off, she had the plaid top "You're about to black out, you need to get out" "We too tall to fit in this small house" Neck all stressed down, hanging-ass red face That or the dog case, more like a comfortable couch Step over the mess gate, into the real house 
Hair on my new wool, looking like cashmere Looking like crow too, magical star shapes Sticky like model cap, feathery silk capes Venomous black crepes, venomous glass snakes Delicate wine flute, help us commiserate Florida date state, they had the best bass Gladly make you a steak, even dig you a lake This is your stereo, it'll keep you awake You're about to black out 
Back and forth catechism, cattle and ammunitionQueen didn't have vision, didn't he Ã¢Â€Â”shitÃ¢Â€Â” mention Dragons were coming soon Should've made harpoons, instead of ornate brooms Bought the museum safe, look where we at now Pillage the village hounds, benzos gone man We're about to black out, stepping into a room Popcorn-sealed fume, expensive like [?] Giant-ass mouth clothes, arrogant all pose Soak-in-the-soap clothes, standing in old clothes Giant-ass mountain ship, cut to the cockpit Focus and close mouth, we're about to black out 
We are too tall, to fit in a dog house What a melodic thing Taller than Seth Green, shorter than Sid Bream Entirely in a dream, we are Hall & Oates Avis' car quotes, saddened and bounded Why weren't we grounded? I was at Wimbledon, close to Ontario Emotional feelings hurt, pissy-pants first grade Smell like your cousin's age, back before Sissy Rage Little man, long legs Samsara horse escape, spiderwebs on clothes Walking with brown face, look at the new apes We're about to smash graves 
2, 3, 4 
I have called you children, I have called you son What is there to answer if I'm the only one? Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light Still I must obey, still I must invite If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you 
I was dressed embarrassment I was dressed in wine If you had a part of me, will you take your time? Even if I come back, even if I die Is there some idea to replace my life? Like a father to impress Like a mother's mourning dress If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you 
I have called you preacher, I have called you son If you have a father or if you haven't one I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you I did everything for you, I did everything for you I did everything for you, I did everything for you I did everything for you, I did everything for you I did everything for you, I did everything for you 
The evil it spread like a fever aheadIt was night when you died, my fireflyWhat could I have said to raise you from the dead?Oh could I be the sky on the Fourth of July? 
Well you do enough talkMy little hawk, why do you cry?Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?Or the Fourth of July?
Weâ..re all gonna die 
Sitting at the bed with the halo at your headWas it all a disguise, like Junior HighWhere everything was fiction, future, and predictionNow, where am I? My fading supply 
Did you get enough love, my little doveWhy do you cry?
And Iâ..
m sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt rightMy little Versailles 
The hospital asked should the body be castBefore I say goodbye, my star in the skySuch a funny thought to wrap you up in clothDo you find it all right, my dragonfly? 
Shall we look at the moon, my little loonWhy do you cry?Make the most of your life, while it is rifeWhile it is light 
Well you do enough talkMy little hawk, why do you cry?Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?Or the Fourth of July?
Weâ..

It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place And when I sleep on your couch I feel very safe And when you bring the blankets I cover up my face I do love you I do love you 
And when you play guitar I listen to the strings buzz The metal vibrates underneath your fingers And when you crochet I feel mesmerized and proud And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard So I won't say it at all And I won't stay very long But you are the life I needed all along I think of you as my brother Although that sounds dumb Words are futile devices 
I know you want it I know you really wanna get it right Have you forsaken, have you mistaken me for someone else? Saturday night you sleep with a rifle at your side Delivering speeches, delivering speeches left and right Follow those created deaths Fortune save me from his wrath Spaceship out the house at night Prophet speak what's on your mind 
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord 
Visit the future, visit the future from the outer space (space space space space) A ring of fire, a ring of fire falling on your face (face face face face) You dream of the dark age, you dream of the dark age of your youth Consider the danger, consider the danger, as it moves Prophet, brother, priest and king (I know you want it, I know you really wanna) Snake-skinned master at your feet (I know you want it, I know you really wanna) Barricade the bathroom doors (I know you want it, I know you really wanna) Find some things you can't ignore (I know you want it, I know you really wanna) 
I know you really gotta get right with the Lord You know you really gotta get right with the Lord 
I know I've caused you trouble I know I've caused you pain But I must do the right thing I must do myself a favor and get real Get right with the Lord I know I've lost my conscious, I know I've lost all shape But I must do the right thing I must do myself a favor and get real Get right with the Lord I know I've always loved you I know I've always been But I must do the right thing I must do myself a favor and get real Get right with the Lord 
Get real, get right for you will not be distracted by the signs Do not be distracted by them Do your favor and get real Get right with the Lord Get real, get right for you will not be distracted by the signs Do not be distracted by them Do yourself a favor and get real Get right with the lord Get real get right with the Lord 
Four degrees off the ground I am lost, forgive me Four degrees off the ground I am lost, forgive me Four degrees off the ground I am lost, forgive me Four degrees off the ground I am lost, forgive me (Only the lonely) 
Reach out for what remains before you Reach out for what remains at hand For as it was in the beginning So shall it cease at my command (Only the lonely) 
Now place your head below your waistline Breathe deeply as the pain subsides And with your final breath, remember The day of rest has now arrived (Only the lonely) 
Oh, my heart will leave you now, surrender Oh, my heart receives you now with arms full of harvest Oh, my heart has fallen for its fear of feelings Stay close to me, my love Theosophy in elegy, love me 
Oh, my heart will fantasize of Eden My love, my dream, make love to me Surrender your spirit, sing my eulogy Oh, my heart is chained to thee, my angel You haven't seen the last of me, my love I give you everything 
Four degrees off the ground I am lost without you (Only the lonely) Four degrees off the ground I am lost without you (Only the lonely) 
I am lost without you (Only the lonely) I am lost without you (Only the lonely) 
I fell in love again All things go, all things go Drove to Chicago All things know, all things know We sold our clothes to the state I don't mind, I don't mind I made a lot of mistakes In my mind, in my mind 
You came to take us All things go, all things go To recreate us All things grow, all things grow We had our mindset All things know, all things know You had to find it All things go, all things go 
I drove to New York In a van with my friend We slept in parking lots I don't mind, I don't mind I was in love with the place In my mind, in my mind I made a lot of mistakes In my mind, in my mind 
You came to take us All things go, all things go To recreate us All things grow, all things grow We had our mindset All things know, all things know You had to find it All things go, all things go

Good King Wenceslas looked out On the feast of Stephen When the snow lay round about Deep and crisp and even Brightly shone the moon that night Though the frost was cruel When a poor man came in sight Gath'ring winter fuel

Here I am alone in my car Hopelessness incorporated I'm driving to wherever you are Now that all of my dreams have been confiscated Circa 1975 Now that it's too late to have died a young man Well, I'm just glad that I'm still alive For what hasn't killed me will make me stronger 
Goodbye to that Goodbye to all of that artifact Goodbye to that Goodbye to all of that artifact 
Tell me what I already know Nothing is left of me, all of this is vertigo Turn around and show me your shadow Now I've left you, I feel all the afterglow

Your burden bright as weary be Periwig on parakeet You're God's great paramour and sweet 
I'm happy, I'm happy Your birthday brings a pardoning I'm happy, I'm happy You're like a bird that will not be 
Yours will number, yours will be A paragon, a Paraclete Keep your bed warm, keep your humor Keep your proverbs short and sweet 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry That life is anxious, life is mean I'm sorry, I'm sorry A pair of shoes is what you need 
I'm happy, I'm happy Your birthday brings a pardoning I'm happy, I'm happy You're like a bird that will not be 1, 2, and 1 2 3 4 
Just this once for Christmas I want us all to be Like one great big happy Family Family 
Bam, bam bam, badadam bam bam 
Would it have been best to forget you Would it have been better for me And if I could write off your intentions Would you pretend you don't love me 
And I wish you a happy karma Christmas And I miss you my happy karma girl My karma girl 
Sometimes I think I'm just a phantom Loneliness grows deep within me I gave you love, I gave you fortune Still you insist you don't love me 
And I wish you a happy karma Christmas And I miss you my happy karma girl And I wish you a happy karma Christmas And I miss you my happy karma girl My karma girl 
[Sufjan:] Yeah I'm still alone Breathing on the floor And I look just like a baby And I feel just like a dog It was my choice It was my first thought You can read it in my waiver You can hear it in my prayer You can feel it in my soul It was my choice The life that I create I am nothing to you I am nothing to you And I may look just like a baby And I may feel just like a dog It may not look just like I'm fading It may not look just like I'm fading

Hark the herald angels sing "Glory to the newborn King! Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled!" Joyful, all ye nations rise Join the triumph of the skies With the angelic host proclaim "Christ is born in Bethlehem" 
Hark! The herald angels sing "Glory to the newborn King!" 
Christ by highest heav'n adored Christ the everlasting Lord Late in time behold Him come Offspring of a virgin's womb Veiled in flesh the Godhead see Hail the incarnate Deity Pleased with us in flesh to dwell Jesus, our Immanuel 
Hark! The herald angels sing "Glory to the newborn King!" 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas Let your heart be light From now on Our troubles will be out of sight 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas Make the Yule-tide gay From now on Our troubles will be miles away 
Here we are as in olden days Happy golden days of yore Faithful friends who are dear to us Gather near to us once more 
Through the years We all will be together If the Fates allow Hang a shining star upon the highest bough And have yourself a merry little Christmas now 
He was, he was in the churchyard My father was in the first part He came, he came to my bedroom But I was asleep 
And he woke me up again to say... 
Halle, halle, hallelujah Holy, holy is the sound And I hope, I hope you are tired out And I know, I know there is joy endowed 
But I was asleep And he woke me up again And he woke me up again to say... 
Hold on, hold on to your old ways Or put off, put off every old face And I know, I know you are changed out And I hope, I hope you're arranged out 
But I'm still asleep And you woke me up again And I'm still asleep But you woke me up to be holy 
Here I am outside Can you hear me? Can you see me? Yet I nearly died Can you hear me? Can you see me? 
But I won't go back where I was before Where I don't belong Can you hear me? Oh, can you see me? For I left that place for a long long time No I won't go back there Can you hear me? Oh, can you see me? 
Here I am outside Can you hear me? Can you see me? And yet I nearly died Could you hear me? Could you see me? 
When I had that look Of a rolling dice And you had to look away Could you see me? Could you hear me? And you would not touch And you would not kiss And you could have left Could you hear me? Could you see me? 
Don't be such a drag As you told me And you showed me I could not get my act together Can you hear me? Oh, can you see me? 
No I won't go back to the glory days When I wasn't right Can you hear me? Oh, can you see me? 
So I'm turning back To the glorious face That the lord has made He can hear me Oh, he can see me 
So I'm turning back To the glorious face That the lord has made He can hear me Oh, he can see me 
Here I am outside Can you hear me? Can you see me? And yet I almost died Can you hear me? Oh, can you see me? 
We can walk out after dark, 
Because it's Christmas time Colored lights glow from the park, Because it's Christmas time. And the bells on the reindeer sled say, It's Christmas time And the quilt on the back of the bed say, It's Christmas time 
I think about how we could run away, Now that it's Christmas time We travel in a one horse open sleigh, Now that it's Christmas time 
There's your father with his pipe, He says it's Christmas time He might let us stay up all night, Because it's Christmas time I might wish you all the best Because it's Christmas time I might kiss you on the back of your neck Because it's Christmas time 
I think about how we could run away, Now that it's Christmas time We travel in a one horse open sleigh, Now that it's Christmas time 
It's Christmas time 

All the time we spent in bed 
Counting miles before we set Fall in love and fall apart Things will end before they start 
Sleeping on Lake Michigan Factories and marching bands Lose our clothes in summer time Lose ourselves to lose our minds In the summer heat, I might 
How shall I fitly meet Thee And give Thee welcome due? The nations long to greet Thee And I would greet Thee too O Fount of light, shine brightly Upon my darken'd heart That I may serve Thee rightly And know Thee as Thou art I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave 
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave

I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave 
I saw three ships come sailing in 
On Christmas day, on Christmas day I saw three ships come sailing in On Christmas day in the morning. 
And what was in those ships all three? On Christmas day, on Christmas day And what was in those ships all three? On Christmas day in the morning. 
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there On Christmas day, on Christmas day The Virgin Mary and Christ were there On Christmas day in the morning. 
Lover, will you look at me now? I'm already dead to you But I'm inclined to explain to you what I could not before Whatever you didn't do, what you couldn't say I am sorry the worst has arrived For I deserve more For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye 
Tell me, do you think of me now As I think of you For I could not have shaken the touch of your breath on my arm For it has stayed in me, as an epithet I am sorry the worst has arrived For I'm on the floor In the room where we made it our last touch of the night 
I walked, 'cause you walked But I won't probably get very far Sensation, to what you said But I'm not about to expect something more 
I would not have run off But I couldn't bear that it's me, it's my fault I should not be so lost But I've got nothing left to love 
Lover, will you look from me now I'm already dead But I've come to explain why I left such a mess on the floor For when you went away, I went crazy I was wild with the breast of a dog I ran through the night With a knife in my chest, with the lust of your loveless life 
I walked, 'cause you walked But I won't probably get very far Sensation, to what you said But I'm not about to expect something more 
I would not have run off But I couldn't bear that it's me, it's my fault I should not be so lost But I've got nothing left to love 
I walked, 'cause you walked Yes I walked, 'cause you walked 
To think that I would die this time 
Isolated in the room where the bed rises Photographic ordinary people are everywhere Extraordinary histories, ordinary histories, ordinary histories 
I'll find sleep, I'll find peace, or in death you'll sleep with me. 
To figure that it was my fault Or so I've come to realize life is not about Love with someone - (ordinary people are everywhere) Extraordinary people are, ordinary people are, ordinary people are 
Everywhere you look, everywhere you turn, illness is watching, waiting its turn. 
Did I go at it wrong? Did I go intentionally to destroy me? I'm suffering in noise I'm suffering in - (touching ordinary body) The burning from within the burning from with - (ordinary is scary now) I could not be at rest, I could not be at peace - (extraordinary is scary now) 
So do yourself a good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes Or do yourself a favor, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes 
Endless lights prey upon the lonely, prey upon the lonely Weightless lights, oh, I would rather be, but I would rather be fine 
I want to be well, I want to be well, I want to be well, I want to be well. 
And I forgive you even As you choke me that way 
With the pill or demon and the shrouding ? 
Under conversation 
In tremendous weight of A crowd of ages outside Dressed for murder 
I'm not fucking around I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around 
And shall I kiss you even as you take me that way? With the pill or demon as my body changes Apparitions gone awry They surround me, all sides From what am I seeing, only changes 
I'm not fucking around I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around 
We were, we were 
We were lovers We had no one But armed puppets 
We were touching We were turning We were eighteen Get to learning 
Saw your mother At the river washing ribbons Saw her sip, saw her sip the East River 
I've seen laid men up and walking I've seen deaf and dead men talking 
And I have had enough of trouble I've been paid in full and double 
Barricade glass against the table Break it farmers if you're, if you're able 
I went dancing with my sister Call her madam, call me mister 
She wore a dress It was nice and something Underneath her dress was slipping 
She did curse it, she did keep it 
She said she did something stupid 
I said: who's the master, Mira? I can't kill or catch a fly dead 
Point me in the right direction Point me to the middle section 
And I have had enough of trouble I've been paid in full and double 
Barricade glass against the table Break it farmers if you're, if you're able 
Barricade glass against the table Break it farmers if you're, if you're, if you're able 
[Sufjan:] I will give it up I won't be afraid I won't try too hard I will touch your back 
I'm prepared for death I will tear my clothes People try too hard I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to? I will lift my hands I'm prepared for death I will tear my clothes People try too hard I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to? I will lift my hands I won't be afraid of this, does anybody want to? 
I won't try too hard I will touch your back I'm prepared for death I won't be afraid 
I will give it up I won't make a mess I won't try too hard I won't be afraid 
I won't be afraid (I won't be afraid) [x8] 
And am I born to die To lay this body down And must my trembling spirit fly Into a world unknown And must my trembling spirit fly Into a world unknown 
A land of deepest shade Unpierced by human thought The dreary regions of the dead Where all things are forgot The dreary regions of the dead Where all things are forgot 
Soon as from earth I go What will become of me Eternal happiness or woe Must then my portion be Eternal happiness or woe Must then my portion be 
Eternal happiness or woe Must then my portion be Eternal happiness or woe Must then my portion be I'll be home for Christmas You can plan on me Please have snow and mistletoe And presents on the tree 
Christmas Eve will find me Where the lovelight gleams I'll be home for Christmas If only in my dreams 
I'll be home for Christmas You can plan on me Please have snow and mistletoe And presents on the tree 
Christmas Eve will find me Where the lovelight gleams I'll be home for Christmas If only in my dreams 
[Part 1 - Sufjan:] Oh, woman, tell me what you want And I'll calm down without bleeding out With a broken heart that you stabbed for an hour Woman, I was freaking out because I want you to know My beloved, you are the lover of my impossible soul 
Woman, too, promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes I was wigging out, too much worry I could not get you at all And you said what you want, you would laugh it off But I know you won't go, not for it at last Must you write it off for the impossible soul? And I was in a dream, I was gone away without you, but not too slow Lest I put it off, for I put it right for the impossible soul And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all, my life, to you If I could get you at all Don't be a wreck, trying to be something that I wasn't at all 
Seems I got it wrong, I was chasing after something that was gone To the black of night, now I know it's not what I wanted at all And you said something like, "All you want is all the world for yourself" But all I want is the perfect love Though I know it's small, I want love for us all 
And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all, my life, to you If I could get you at all Trying to be something that I wasn't at all 
[Part 2 - Shara Worden and Sufjan Stevens:] Do you want to be afraid? Do you want to be afraid? For life in the cage where courage's mate runs deep in the wake For the scariest things are not half as enslaved 
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted Do you want to be alone? Do you want to be alone? For life isn't stained of righteousness pain The seed and the hail, all impossible flights for an interesting light 
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted Do you want to love me more? Do you want to love me more? For love is the breath If water and wave Is cursed by the same thing that nurtured its shame Is it worth all the work? 
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain) Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain) Instead of the life, lived tired and lost, have you left it at last 
Where it floundered its death with the language of ghosts 
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain) Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain) For life in the cage (for life in the cage) Where courage's mate (where courage's mate) Runs deep in the wake (runs deep in the wake) For the scariest things (for the scariest things) Are not half as enslaved (are not half as enslaved) 
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted Now 
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted Now 
(No, don't be distracted) (x13) 
[Instrumental break] 
[Part 3 - Sufjan:] Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest All my delight, all that mattered, I couldn't be at rest From what I liked, from what I gathered, I couldn't be at rest Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest 
And don't be shy in the window Come down and give your best Oh, delight in the window I couldn't be at rest Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest From what I liked, from what I gathered, I couldn't give my best 
Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to breathe at all Oh, I know it wasn't safe, it wasn't safe to speak at all

Do you wanna dance? In the right life, it's a miracle Possibility, do you wanna dance?

Since it's Christmas, let's be glad 
Even if your life's been bad There are presents to be had 
Take a walk out in the snow And hear Santa's "Ho ho ho!" He's got a million miles to go 
La la la la la la ah 
Sing a carol to your mom Because she knows what's going on And she knows if you've been bad or good 
And if you get what you deserve To be graded on the curve Oh, you got a lot of nerve 
La la la la la la ah 
Since the year is almost out Left your hands and give a shout There's a lot to shout about today 
Since it's Christmas, let's be glad Even if the year's been bad There are presents to be had A promotion for your dad Don't be angry don't be mad 
I'm not afraid of the black man running 
He's got it right, he's got a better life comin' And I don't care what the Captain said I fold it right at the top of my head I lost my sight and the state packs in I follow my heart and it leads me right to Jackson 
(Oh Keller, oh oh oh oh) She gave us a medal she gave us a map (Oh Canner Row, oh oh oh) If seeing is right, then look where you're at 
I'm not afraid of Nichol's Park I ride the train and I ride it after dark And I'm not afraid to get it right I turn around and I give it one more try And I said things that I meant to say The bandstand chairs and the Dewey Day Parade I go out to the Golden Age The spirit is right and the spirit doesn't change 
(Oh Keller, oh oh oh oh) She gave us a mirror, she gave us a map (Oh Canner Row, oh oh oh) If seeing is right, then look where you're at 
Andrew Jackson! All I'm asking Show us the wheel, and give us the wine Raise the Banner, Jackson Hammer! 
Everyone goes to the capitol line 
Colored Preacher, nice to meet you! The spirit is here, and the spirit is fine Education! Ask the nation! You gave us our sight and the hearing is fine Andrew Jackson! All I'm asking Give us the wheel, and give us the wine Jason, you're the only one Jason, like a steady son Like that, you're the only one Take that, when the runner's come 
When the right dragon comes around When the knight horses burn the ground 
Jason, you're the only one Jason, like a steady son 
(You're the only one) 
Jason, you're the circle sun Jason, run the rabbit run Like that, you're the steady gun Like that, what the Argon won 
When the right dragon comes around When the knight horses burn the ground When the right you gave me To make it through the night When the right dragon comes around 
(You're the only one) 
We were young and noble Riding on a plane for freedom run A plane for freedom run 
Are we to speak, first day of the weekStumbling words at the barBeauty blue eyes, my order of friesLong island kindness and wineBeloved of John, I get it all wrongI read you for some kind of poemCovered in lines, the fossils I find Have they no life of their own? 
So can we pretend sweetlyBefore the mystery ends?I am a man with a heart that offends With its lonely and greedy demands
Thereâ..s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead 
Such a waste, your beautiful faceStumbling carpet ariseGo follow your gem, your white feathered friendIcarus, point to the sunIf history speaks of two baby teeth
Iâ..m painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord hear my prayer
Iâ..ve wasted my throes on your head 
So can we be friends, sweetlyBefore the mystery ends?I love you more than the world can containIn its lonely and ramshackle head
Thereâ..
s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead 
Iâ..m holding my breath
My tongue on your chestWhat can be said of my heart?If history speaks, the kiss on my cheekWhere there remains but a mark 
Beloved my John, so Iâ..ll carry on
Counting my cards down to oneAnd when I am dead, come visit my bedMy fossil is bright in the sun 
So can we contend, peacefullyBefore my history ends?Jesus I need you, be near me, come shield meFrom fossils that fall on my head
Thereâ..
s only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead 
Are we to speak, first day of the week Stumbling words at the bar Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries Long island kindness and wine Beloved of John, I get it all wrong I read you for some kind of stone Covered in lines, the fossils I find Have they no life of their own? 
So can we pretend sweetly Before the mystery ends? I am a man with a heart that offends With its lonely and greedy demands There's only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead 
Such a waste, your beautiful face Slumbering carpet arise But you and your ring, your life-giving string Come to me now as a friend If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek I'm painting the hills blue and red They said beware, Lord hear my prayer Anointing my love on your head 
So can we be friends sweetly Before the mystery ends? I love you more than the world can contain In its loneliest ramshackle head There's only a shadow of me; in a manner of speaking I'm dead 
I'm holding my breath My signature death What can be said of my heart? If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek Where there remains but a mark Beloved my John, so I'll carry on Counting my cards down to one And when I am dead, return to the bed My fossil is bright in the sun 
His father was a drinker 
And his mother cried in bed Folding John Wayne's T-shirts When the swingset hit his head The neighbors they adored him For his humor and his conversation Look underneath the house there Find the few living things Rotting fast in their sleep of the dead Twenty-seven people, even more They were boys with their cars, summer jobs Oh my God 
Are you one of them? 
He dressed up like a clown for them With his face paint white and red And on his best behavior In a dark room on the bed he kissed them all He'd kill ten thousand people With a sleight of his hand Running far, running fast to the dead He took off all their clothes for them He put a cloth on their lips Quiet hands, quiet kiss On the mouth 
And in my best behavior 
I am really just like him Look beneath the floorboards For the secrets I have hid 
I would like to throw a field 
Yes, I would like to be a man I would serve the Kingdom's will Yes, I would enter to the end 
Blessed is the man who waits And blessed is the man who starts

My father, working nights First shift, eternal light The curse of Adam labor Outside, in the parking lot The current of wind and the light went hot He held his head in terror By jove and by surprise The current of lightning filled with light It burned his hands with symbols White noise as Lucifer The sacred fire, the sacred fern Conceived with holy water 
His radiance in the dark Mysterious shape or beauty mark As if it were Minerva Breastplate of Jupiter The hovering deep, he spoke the word The light, the virgin creature All dreams and all disease are fantasy features, ill-conceived Illusions worth remembering 
My father, late at night Forbidding death, he kissed the light As Jupiter transfigured 
I need you to change me, prevent you, persuade me By jove I need you, sensation, my virtue, persuasion By jove 
Father of light Father of death Give us your wisdom, give us your breath Summoner says that Jupiter is the loneliest planet Red right eye Put in its place Under your foot, carpenter's cape Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet Floundering star Failed that you are Fevering pitch Figure of speech Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet 
Say it with faith Say it with force Say it to my face Put me in place Sermon of death says Lucifer is the only conquest Hurricane heart, hurricane haste Wandering star, pick up your pace Sermon of death says Jupiter is the only contest Father of light Father of death Give us your wisdom, give us your breath Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet 
Silver and gold, silver and gold Everyone wishes for it How do you measure its worth? Just by the pleasure it gives here on earth. 
Oh, I'm getting old Oh, I'm getting old Everyone wishes for youth How have I wasted my life? Trusting the pleasure it gives here on earth 
Lord, come with fire Lord, come with fire Everyone's wasting their time Storing up treasure in vain Trusting the pleasure it gives here on earth 
Oh, I see the end Oh, I see the end Everyone's waiting for death How do you measure its worth? Justice delivers its gift here on earth 
Silver and gold, silver and gold Silver and gold, silver and gold 
He took the stable 
Bred me to be a mare Made the brethren able Gave me a room 
I never asked him I never meant meant to stay He dressed the table Wore a dress to be my mare 
There's no pertinence When you never leave the stall He ran to other wars Won't write me at all 
I want to kill him I want to cut his brain And when it's over I know I'll feel okay 
He was a champion We were riding side by side Into the frontier He left me without a ride 
Where did the hour go When the champions intercede? He stole the cargo Took every chance to leave There's no pertinence When you never leave the stall He ran to other wars Won't write me at all 
I want to kill him I want to cut his brain And when it's over I know I'll feel okay 
I want to kill him I want to cut his face And when it's over I know I'll feel okay 
I want I want I want I want 
Take me into all of your life I am the future, define the future I was only thinking of human kindness I am the future, define the future 
I have always wanted to be here with you Love me the first time, love me the last time Something that I wanted to see through with you I am the future, define the future 
Is this the way you make me ask for something more? Is this the reason why you walk back through the door? You wanna rebel but you hold yourself, indecision And something tells me that you gave it all up over division 
Take me into all of your lifetime I am the future, define the future Take me into all of your lasting lifetime I am the future, define the future 
I was only thinking of human kindness Love me the first time, love me the last time Take me into all of your lamentations I am the future, define the future 
It was something of a second life It was something of an anaphylaxis I saw the same shit, I saw the light You get me out of this and I'll give you access 
At the risk of sounding like a Confucian I saw your body and I saw what I liked Let's keep it simple, give me absolution Let's take a walk in the circle of light 
It was something of an afterthought It was something sort of unprecedented I saw the same shit, like it or not I saw the hemisphere, I didn't invent it 
It was something of a reinvention You took my breath away, I took my time Let's keep it simple, give me absolution Let's take a walk in the circle of light 
Let's take a walk in the circle of light Let's take a walk in the circle of light Let's take a walk in the circle of light 
We step in the light The rise of our tide My love is a wave You got me caught in a landslide There's nowhere to run There's nowhere to hide My love is a wave You got me caught in a landslide 
It was something of a second chance It was something of a phantom synapsis Now everything is slipping out of my hands You get me out of this and I'll give you access 
At the risk of sounding like a Confucian I'm gonna take it one day at a time Let's keep it simple, give me absolution Let's take a walk in the circle of light 
Let's take a walk in the circle of light Let's take a walk in the circle of light Let's take a walk in the circle of light 
We step in the light The rise of our tide My love is a wave You got me caught in a landslide There's nowhere to run There's nowhere to hide My love is a wave You got me caught in a landslide 
Landslide Landslide Landslide Landslide Landslide Landslide Oh the weather outside is frightful But the fire is so delightful And since we've no place to go Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping And I've bought some corn for popping And the lights are turned way down low Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Let it snow, let it snow 
When we finally kiss goodnight How I'll hate going out in the storm But if you'll really hold me tight All the way home I'll be warm 
Oh the fire is slowly dying And my dear, we're still good-bying But as long as you love me so Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates Behold, the King of glory waits The King of kings is drawing near The Savior of the world is here 
O blest the land, the city blest Where Christ the Ruler is confessed O happy hearts and happy homes To whom this King in triumph comes

Dreams go and stay below The cattle call and the old dark soul I respect that Santa left To save his kids from the winter cold Would you like to stay a while and dance with me? Mistletoe and chestnuts roasting on the street 
The only condition (I know the one) I've got the premonition (I've got a clue) That Christmas is a vision (For Christmas) Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho If drinking makes it easy (So pass one here) The music's kinda cheesy (And sing a cheer) The specials on the TV (Especially) Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

Move me Move like the waters I cannot drink I have lost my patience Make me an offer I cannot refuse 
Move through to me Show me the face of all of my dreams Was it all for nothing? Make me an offer I cannot refuse

Move like a centipede Foolish as I am, follow my lead I have lost my preference Make me an offer I cannot refuse

One dark day the trees began a trumpet sound, trumpet sound We sat listening patiently, the sky was near and I felt the trembling motion we ran out to see the future, from the ground from the ground from the ground from the ground people died and people risen everywhere We held hands and made a circle quietly from the ground quietly from the ground We returned and set the table, by the door 
In the future, there will be no war The loneliness outside And the stones cry out for mercy Will they see the Lord The prophecy grows sight As it is written I am the God of war I reside in every creature Dispose of the future Or put away your sword 
Until the future There will only be war The ugliness inside And after all the devastation Will we see the Lord As it is written I am the future I am the God of war I reside in every creature Dispose of the future Or put away your sword All that I've known to be of life And I'm gentle You ran off with it all And I'm faithful All that I've held within my arms And I'm weightless You ran off with it all And I'm speechless All that I've said to get it right And I'm confident You ran off with it all 
And I'm steadfast All that I thought, to be precise And I'm consequence You ran off with it all And I'm sorry 
And I'm sorry All that I've known to be at peace And I'm desperate You ran off with it all And I'm restless All that I've known to be of love And I'm gentle You ran off with it all And I'm desperate All that I dreamed Where do you run, where do you run to? And I'm evidenced All that I dreamed Where do you run, where do you run to? And I'm faithless All that I dreamed Where do you run, where do you run to? And I messed up All that I dreamed Where do you run, where do you run to? Carry on friends Where do you run? 
Jack rabbit trumped with a generous mood Offering itself on the fire for food Touched by his virtue, the fortune approved Outlining ears on the virtuous moon As I'm about to enter your world As I'm about to enter your world I give you light 
Some say the crane was the call for two Stretched by the weight as her legs withdrew Carrying the chariot, the rabbit assumed Washing her face with the redheaded hubris As I'm about to enter your world As I'm about to enter your world I give you blood It's time to tango with the frisky, frosty Frosty Man He's got a temperature of negative degrees again He likes ice cream and Yo La Tengo with the jammin' pants You got to cool it with the hipster costly Frosty Man He's chillin', illin', thrillin' with the Mr. Saucy Pants He likes to keep it real, he likes to talk a little sense He's got a friend called Coolio, Vanilla Ice, and Ice Cube Banana split and frozen pie and Mr. Frosty Pants

After the storm we shaved our legs to the skin Into the snow our footprints showed where we'd been They gave us names, they said my name means war Dwelling in song, the lion and the lamb were restored 
Illumination, accede my need, my Rajneesh Hallucination, accede my need, my Rajneesh 
I lit a fire and drank of the breath of his kiss My tambourine affirmed by the dance of his wrist Mystical star, burn bright like the tail of a dog Now we are blessed with the righteousness of the Lord 
Illumination, accede my need, my Rajneesh Hallucination, accede my need, my Rajneesh Illumination, accede my need, my Rajneesh Hallucination, accede my need, my Rajneesh

I'm on a path of love. I'm on a parrot. Possess me with prayer on the bluff. I'm on a task for God. Entheogen, you lift me within Upanishad 
Bright as a thunderbird, singing: "You stare at the sun to see the sublime Forgetting the light that makes you go blind." 
Osho you ask of us, singing: "If courage is love of the unknown Consider the powers parading you home" 
I'm a path of love, saying: "You stand in the shade to feel was it blessed Obscuring from light the seeds you possess." 
I'm on a path of trust, singing: "Whatever it takes receive of the light The terror will take whatever it likes." 
Oh, to see without my eyes The first time that you kissed me Boundless by the time I cried I built your walls around me White noise, what an awful sound Fumbling by Rogue River Feel my feet above the ground Hand of God, deliver me 
Oh, woah woe is me The first time that you touched me Oh, will wonders ever cease? Blessed be the mystery of love 
Lord, I no longer believe Drowned in living waters Cursed by the love that I received From my brother's daughter Like Hephaestion, who died Alexander's lover Now my riverbed has dried Shall I find no other? 
Oh, woah woe is me I'm running like a plover Now I'm prone to misery The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me 
How much sorrow can I take? Blackbird on my shoulder And what difference does it make When this love is over? Shall I sleep within your bed River of unhappiness Hold your hands upon my head Till I breathe my last breath 
Oh, woah woe is me The last time that you touched me Oh, will wonders ever cease? Blessed be the mystery of love What's right And what's wrong? Don't you hold me too tightly Two words as I've rounded them off To the nearest of ten 
For I gathered your body In envious capture In envious thought 
Oh forgive me, oh gods Or forgive me in fortune Forgive me in feeling it out for myself As I ought to have feelings for something As great as thou art 
Some great white rose Of youth, your pleasure Gives my own arm Generous portions, wisely Breaks of my own heart I felt the arm's length While I've gone on my own way 
Conserve me, strange waters Come and obey me, strange waters Have it your own way 
So if you won't hold me I have no objections So if you won't please me I have no commands So if you don't trust me It's best if I drown We had friends downstate When we drove we went to Canada If we were asked to stay I was brave I was brave I was brave 
From the top of the mountain You could see Lake Erie Niagara Falls From the top of the fountain I could see farther than anyone 
Driving through the line We pretend we are from Africa If we fall far behind I am brave I am brave I am brave 
Up in the highest of heights O'Hara blinks and fights This land is yours; this land is mine. I see the Captain in red, and Cairo at his head. This land is yours; this land is mine. 
The lightning over the park, the waters--brash and dark We take a swim; we take a swim. I never meant to escape the carpet and the trade This land is yours; this land is mine. 
And when I make up my mind I change it all the time I take it back; I take it back. The numbers over the dam, Jo Davies and the band, I count them out; I count them out. 
There was a car in the bay by the boat that swept and swayed Whoever you are in the light in the water that we made I'm counting it out I'm counting it out I'm working it out inside 
I'm counting it out to the floor 
The ferry hatches Moline Panola Beauty Queen She takes a bow; she takes a bow. In Charles, we climb the hill and Danville window sill I take it back; I take it back. My sister she counts the bars, the Macon county cars, She takes a bow; she takes a bow. 
The Mississippi amends the Carver and the bends This land is yours; this land is mine. My brother punches my ear. The injured ivory deer I call my dad; I call my dad. We skip inside of the store the Mason winter door This land is yours; this land is mine. 
There was a car in the bay by the boat that swept and swayed Whoever you are in the light in the water that we made I'm holding your hand by the shore With our collars pulled up tight 
I'm counting it out I'm counting it out I'm working it out inside I'm counting it out 
(This land is not your land For the right hand takes what it can, ransacks with the mad man. For this land is not yours or mine to have. This land was made for the good of itself.) 
Now that I fell into your arms My only lover Give out to give in I search for the capsule I lost 
Drag me to hell In the valley of The Dalles Like my mother Give wings to a stone It's only the shadow of a cross 
I slept on my back In the shade of the meadowlark Like a champion Get drunk to get laid I take one more hit when you depart 
I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart Lonely vampire Inhaling it's fire I'm chasing the dragon too far 
There's blood on that blade Fuck me, I'm falling apart My assassin Like Casper the ghost There's no shade in the shadow of the cross 
It's different now I think 
I wasn't older yet I wasn't wise, I guess Somewhere I lost whatever else I had I wasn't over you I see it run inside itself And then I called you out I'm not such older than I was I'm feeling so much righter now And then I woke myself, confused Your dress comes down To you, don't get it wrong, don't get excited I wanted so much to be at rest Now that I'm older So be it so of love 
The silent man comes down All dressed in radiant colors You see it for yourself To demonstrate my love for you You I thought I was so in love Some say it wasn't true Now that I'm older Now, now that I'm older 
There's so much travel And now that I'm older Someone else, can see it for myself So much travel, yeah Now that I'm older 
O come, O come, Emmanuel And ransom captive Israel That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appear Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! 
O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer Our spirits by Thine advent here Disperse the gloomy clouds of night And death's dark shadows put to flight. Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel And ransom captive Israel Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! 
O come, O come, Thou Lord of might, Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height, In ancient times did'st give the Law, In cloud, and majesty and awe. Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice! 
Oh holy night! The stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth! Long lay the world in sin and error pining Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth. A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn! 
Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices Oh night divine Oh night when Christ was born Oh night divine Oh night divine 
Truly He taught us to love one another His law is love and His gospel is peace Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother And in His name all oppression shall cease Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, Let all within us praise His holy name. 
Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices Oh night divine Oh night when Christ was born Oh night divine Oh night divine Oh God, hold me now Oh Lord, hold me now There's no other man who could raise the dead So do what you can to anoint my head 
Oh God, where are you now? Oh Lord, say somehow The devil is hard on my face again The world is a hundred to one again 
Would the righteous still remain? Would my body stay the same? 
Oh God, hold me now Oh God, touch me now There's no other man who could save the dead There's no other God to place our head 
Would the righteous still remain? Would my body stay the same? 
There's no other man who could raise the dead So do what you can to anoint my head 
Oh God, hold me now Oh Lord, touch me now 
Once in royal David's city 
Stood a lowly cattle shed Where a mother laid her baby In a manger for His bed Mary was that mother mild Jesus Christ her little child 
He came down to earth from heaven Who is God and Lord of all And His shelter was a stable And His cradle was a stall With the poor, oppressed and wholly Lived on earth our Savior holy 
And our eyes At last shall see Him Through His own redeeming love For that child, so dear and gentle Is our Lord in heaven above And He leads His children along To the place where He is gone Only to bring you peace Only at Christmas time Only the king of kings Only what once was mine It takes the end of time It takes a long long time Only one thought of mine Only at Christmas time 
He brings us peace He brings us joy He brings all thoughts to destroy Only at Christmas time 
To brings us peace To brings us joy To brings all thoughts to destroy Only at Christmas time 
Only at Christmas time Only a tree to climb Only at Christmas time If you can read the sign Only at Christmas time Everything lost will find Only at Christmas time Only at Christmas time 
I wasn't willing To fight on the floor Throwing the chairs through the door And I wasn't willing To fight on the floor Something to say to the poor 
The storms in July Took off the trees Took off the place to be The animals died Once in a while Once in a while 
And I wasn't willing To make up the bed Folding the sheets to your head And I wasn't willing To say it again Waiting for things to be 
The storms in July Took off the trees Took off the place to be The animals died Once in a while Once in a while 
I'm not afraid of you now, I know 
So I climbed down from the bunk beds this low 
I can talk back to you now, I know From a few things I learned from this TV show 
You can work late till midnight, we don't care We can fix our own meals, we can wash our own hair 
I go to school before sunrise, in the cold And I pulled the alarm, and I kicked up the salad bowls 
Since the time we meant to say much Unsaid things begin to take their toll After school we shoveled through the snow Drive upstate in silence in the cold 
You can remind me of it That I was lazy and tired You can work all your life as I'm not afraid of you anymore 
If I loved you a long time, I don't know If I can't recall the last time you told me so 
Here in this house in Pittsfield The ghost of our grandmother works at the sewing machine post Hiding the bills in the kitchen on the floor And my sister lost her best friend in the Persian Gulf War There was a flood in the bathroom last May And you kicked at the pipes when it rattled oh the river it made 
Stand there, tell me that I'm of no use Things unspoken break us if we share There's still time to wash the kitchen floor On your knees, at the sink once more You can remind me that I was tired You can work late and give yourself up Now that I'm older, wiser, and working less I don't regret having left the place a mess 
You can remind me that I was lazy and tired You can recall your life as I'm not afraid of you, anymore Anymore 
Jupiter, bad June You know my arms ache And I've organized my face 
Sweet sun sister, moon Seasons have shown How your providence takes shape 
My little eye shadow Bruised by the moon's paddle Lipstick eyeliner replaced 
Charon, the fog lifted Messenger dwarfism Let's leave evidence to rest 
Pluto, silly goose Why did you hide Behind coverlings of shame? 
Smooth, splendid abuse Won't you tell me How to deal with my own? 
Sworn by Persephone Our melancholy She waits forever in your kiss 
Lonely passageway Orbiting castaway Beat your beauty at your breast 
Don't surprise me You monster, you master Make an ever last request 
Peoria! Destroyia! Infinity! Divinity! 
For Lydia! Octavia! And Jack-of-Trades! The Cubs! Hooray!

A government has gone this far A covenant prepared to part Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me 
If I'm alone in saying, "yes" I'll change my views and try my best Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me Peace to me 
Take it only if you boldly Cannot take it (Jumps and lonely) Presidents and magistration Spend on golf And spring vacation (Peace to me! We are the holy ones!) 
Put the lights on the tree

I never felt so safe 
A line I once told her Warm resting place Her arm on my shoulder 
you are the rock you are the rake you are the one when I watch myself you are the rock you are the rake you are the one when I watch myself 
we ran into a cave when the wars came closer she turned into a cave where it turned colder

Once when our mother called 
She had a voice of last year's cough We passed around the phone Sharing a word about Oregon 
When my turn came I was ashamed When my turn came I was ashamed 
Once when we moved away She came to Romulus for a day Her Chevrolet broke down We prayed it never be fixed or be found 
We touched her hair We touched her hair We touched her hair We touched her hair 
When she had her last child Once when she had some boyfriend somewhile She moved away quite far Our Grampa bought us a new VCR 
We watched it all night We grew up in spite of it We watched it all night We grew up in spite of it We saw her once last fall Our Grampa died in a hospital gown She didn't seem to care She smoked in her room and coloured her hair

raised from the start By a priest and the maid on the part. Still know what to wear on my back: Michigan! Ponshewaing! Cadillac! 
If I ever meant to go away I was raised, I was reaised In the place, in the place. Still I often think of going back To the farms, to the farms Golden arms, golden arms start to remind me. 
If the lakes took the place of the sea. If the cars drove themselves, way to be! Opposite the trains moving in Rivers run interstate, Michigan! 
Still I never meant to go away I was raised, I was raised In the place, in the place. 
Still I often think of going back To the farms, to the farms Golden arms, golden arms.

I should have known better To see what I could see My black shroudHolding down my feelingsA pillar for my enemies

When I was three, and free to exploreI saw her face on the back of the door Be my rest, be my fantasy 
I should have known better Nothing can be changedThe past is still the pastThe bridge to nowhereI should have wrote a letter Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling

My sister had two babies at one time, they were Siamese twins, no they were actually, they were connected at the head, at the head, and the doctor cut them apart, and my sister said, "I have two kids now, look at me." 
Silent night, holy night All is calm, all is bright Round yon virgin mother and child Holy infant so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace 
Silent night holy night Shepherds quake at the sight Glories stream from heaven afar Heavenly hosts sing alleluia Christ the Savior is born Christ the Savior is born 
What the water wants is hurricanes 
And sailboats to ride on its back What the water wants is sun kiss And land to run into and back 
I have a fish stone burning my elbow Reminding me to know that I'm glad That I have a bottle filled with my old teeth They fell out like a tear in the bag 
And I have a sister somewhere in Detroit She has black hair and small hands And I have a kettledrum I'll hit the earth with you 
And I will crochet you a hat And I have a red kite I'll put you right in it I'll show you the sky 
I was the best man in a size too small 
You were my best friend, going at it all And what if I put off my inheritance? Where is the best man? All arise us all in peace 
I still know you And I still like you, the best man And I still owe you 
Everything rises, going at it all All the surprises in a size too small And what if I told you I was still in love with this? Would you surprise us in a size for all of me? 
I still know you And I still like you, the best man I still know you, the best man I still owe you 
Oh Sleeping Bear! Ran to the top and got scared of what I could see. 
Oh Lamb of God! Tell us your perfect design and give us the rod. 
Oh Sturgeon Bay! Covered completely in sand And covered in sun. 
Oh Saint Marie! Give up the rocking boats drowned. The Captain is done 
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling Ring-ting-tingling too Come on, it's lovely weather For a sleigh ride together with you Outside the snow is falling And friends are calling "Yoo hoo" Come on, it's lovely weather For a sleigh ride together with you 
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up Let's go, let's look at the show We're riding in a wonderland of snow Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up It's grand, just holding your hand We're gliding along with a song Of a wintry fairy land 
Our cheeks are nice and rosy And comfy cozy are we We're snuggled up together Like two birds of a feather would be Let's take that road before us And sing a chorus or two Come on, it's lovely weather For a sleigh ride together with you 
I don't care to say what 
I failed to recognize Every single day from the poker to the prize Running out of Springfield I worked for the Capitol Air, in the bags Found a woman there who said she had a mind to make me a messenger man 
If my father took his life for the national plan, I don't care I'm not about to stick my grave with an apron and a bucket of plans, never ever I can take the pillow cases off the yellow pillows, make a property line from the bed In the living room, the living room, the morning papers made the most out of nothing at all 
So we took the room with a view of the runaway I took off my clothes, and she took it for a holiday I was taken for all the things that I never had before Running out of Springfield she left me with a note saying: 
"Bobby, don't look back." 
And if my wife took a bicycle ride with a knife in her hand I saw it coming All the shad-flies run at once with a trumpet or a train, oh I'm running from it 
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Give a minute, lady I can explain the aftershave Wait a minute, wait a minute, give a minute Bobby got a shad fly caught in his hair 
Is someone gonna cut me some slack? Now that it's a quarter to ten Come on baby gimme some sugar You tell me that you wanna fall back But I don't wanna do this again Come on baby gimme some sugar 
Stand up straight now stand real tall And wipe that writing off the wall This is the right time Come on baby gimme some sugar Now put one foot in front of the other Take a breath now breathe, my lover Let's take up this lifeline Come on baby gimme some sugar

All the shit they try to feed us Don't drink the poison or they'll defeat us This is the right time Come on baby gimme some sugar Don't break my heart, don't break my flow now And all this rage has got to go now Let's take up this lifeline Come on baby gimme some sugar 
Don't make me wait (Don't make me wait) Don't make me wait too long (Don't make me wait too long) Don't make sing the sad song Come on baby gimme some sugar Don't make me wait (Don't make me wait) Don't make me wait too long (Don't make me wait too long) Don't make sing the sad song Come on baby gimme some sugar Don't make me wait Don't make me wait too long Don't make sing the sad song Come on baby gimme some sugar 
Don't make me wait Come on baby gimme some sugar Love, peace, forgiveness And consequence And trust, and patience, affection Determining how long I hold you in as compensate Contemplate, rhapsody Energy in tow The things to look for 
Love and peace, forgiveness And consequence And trust, and patience, affection Determining how long I hold you in as compensate Contemplate, rhapsody Energy in tow The things to look for 
Love, I hold you in as Fantasy, blasphemy Fallacy, and probably as fate These are the names for love

[Hook x2 - Sufjan Stevens:] Love Take me to your room I want to be your friend 
[Sufjan:] Will you walk me home at night? Will you send me showers of light? I want to be your friend 
Will you kiss me on the lips? Will you fill my lunar eclipse? I want to be your friend 
Will you touch me in the car? Will you say that I am your star? I want to be your friend 
Will you keep me safe from harm? Will you hold me close in your arms? I want to be your friend 
[Hook x2] 
And I have no appetite And I can not sleep through the night I want to be your friend 
I've got pictures in my head My own thought of you in my bed I want to be your friend 
With terror you may find For I fear I'm losing my mind I want to be your friend 
And my heart is such a mess And I feel that I am possessed I want to be your friend 
[Hook x5] 
My love, I've lost my faith in everything Tell me you love me anyway Tell me you love me anyway 
(Tell me you love me) My love, I feel myself unraveling Tell me you love me anyway Tell me you love me anyway 
(Tell me you love me) My love, I feel the darkness on my back Something inside me like a wave (Something inside) Something inside me like a wave (Something inside me like a wave) 
(Tell me you love me) (My love) Right now I could a change of heart (My love) Or a kiss before everything falls apart (My love) Can you tell me this love will last forever? (Tell me you love me) (My love) As the world turns, making such a mess (My love) What's the point of it when everything's dispossessed? (My love) Can we carry this love across the desert? 
(Tell me you love me) My love, I wish I was a photograph Perfect and lovely in a frame (Perfect and lovely) Perfect and lovely in a frame (Perfect and lovely in a frame) 
(Tell me you love me) My love, my life could be an epitaph Something to write upon my grave (Something to write) Something to write upon my grave (Something to write upon my grave) 
(Tell me you love me) (My love) Right now, I could use a change of plans (My love) When it all falls, what's the use of open hands? (My love) Can you tell me this love will last forever? (Tell me you love me) (My love) And as the world burns, breathing in the blight (My love) What's the point of it if morning turns into night? (My love) Can we carry this love? It's now or never 
I'm gonna love you I'm gonna love you every day I'm gonna love you I'm gonna love you every day I'm gonna love you I'm gonna love you every day I'm gonna love you I'm gonna love you every day I'm gonna love you every day I'm gonna love you 
Going outside 
Shoveling snow in the driveway, driveway Taking our shoes Riding a sled down the hillside, hillside Can you say what you want? Can you say what you want to be? Can you be what you want? Can you be what you want? 
Our father yells Throwing gifts in the wood stove, wood stove My sister runs away Taking her books to the schoolyard, schoolyard In time the snow will rise In time the snow will rise In time the Lord will rise In time the Lord will rise 
Silent night Holy night Silent night Nothing feels right 
When I am dead and the light leaves my breast Nothing to be told, nothing to confess Let the record show what I couldn't quite confess For by living for myself, I was living for unrest Then the evidence came back in a chariot of vindication Something to behold, glorious in its path But the prophecy fell back as it gave to me an invitation Show them what is right, show them what is blessed 
But now it strikes me far too late again That I was asking far too much of everyone around me And now it strikes me far too late again That I should answer for myself as the ascension falls upon me 
So what should be said of a life that leaves its mess? For once your life was sold, it could never be possessed You were selfishly as a continent, you were finally at your best For you favored for yourself when selfishness was blessed Then Cordelia came back in a chariot hallucination Something to rejoice, glorious in its wrath But the prophecy was a pantomime as it came to me in accusation Show them what is right, show them what is best 
But now it strikes me far too late again That I was asking far too much of everyone around me And now it strikes me far too late again That I should answer for myself as the ascension falls upon me 
And now it frightens me, the thought against my chest To think I was asking for a reason explaining why everything's a total mess And now it frightens me, the dreams that I possess To think I was acting like a believer when I was just angry and depressed And to everything there is no meaning, a season of pain and hopelessness I shouldn't have looked for revelation, I should have resigned myself to this 
I thought I could change the world around me I thought I could change the world for best I thought I was called in convocation I thought I was sanctified and blessed 
But now it strengthens me to know the truth at last That everything comes from consummation, and everything comes with consequence And I did it all with exultation while you did it all with hopelessness Yes, I did it all with adoration while you killed it off with all of your holy mess 
What now? What now? 
I call ye cabin neighbors I call you once my friends But I trust when you labor And put my head to rest 
But I was on the hatch I was on the avalanche And I had found my match I was on the floor 
I took a train from Virginia To Illinois, my home He said "I knew you had it in ya" A mind to make its own 
But I was on the hatch Riding on the avalanche I tried to take it back I was on the floor 
Come on, Stone! Come on, Star! Come on, Snow! Come on, Car! Come on, Hands! Come on, Feet! Come on, Face! Come on, Street! Come on, State! 
Come on, Song! Move it fast! (Take it up) Move it along! (The Ohio River) Come on, Life! (Take it up) Come on, Lord! (Take it over) Make it right! (To the Mississippi) Make it Yours! 
Positive Christmas energy, desperately seeking Santa, Take 3 
Once in a while, you may think you see better than the others Scrambling around in the dark with your drum There is a time when young men must grow up and be brothers Are you afraid of growing too fast? 
And the child with the star on his head All of the world rests on his shoulders And the mother with the child on her breast Blessed is she among women 
And the trust we put in things In small ideas, in engineering The world of sports and second best In consequences we will not put to rest 
Why crawl around in the snow When you know I am right here Waiting for you to expect something more? 
For I am warm, I am calling you close to my table Where I have made us a feast For the year of troubles, they have gone The winter brings a Christmas song 
And the child with the star on his head All of the world rests on his shoulders And the mother with the child on her breast Blessed is she among women 
Does all the world know better than When Christmas comes the troubles end The troubles end, the troubles end 
And by the time thereÃ¢Â€Â™s nothing left An empty tree, a winter vest A winter vest, a winter vest 
And all the trust we put in things In dictionaries, in engineering In calendars, and television In father's friends, in consequences 
I can see a lot of life in you 
I can see a lot of bright in you And I think the dress looks nice on you I can see a lot of life in you 
I can see a bed and make it too I can see a fireside turn blue And I can see the lot of life in you Yes, I can see a lot of life in you 
When the world looks back when the face looks after that I can see a lot of life in you Yes, I can see a lot of life in you 
I can see a lot of life in you I can see your bed and make it too And I think the dress looks nice on you Yes, I can see a lot of life in you 
I can see a lot of life in you Yes, I can see a lot of life in you 
Jesus our brother, strong and good Was humbly born in a stable rude And the friendly beasts around Him stood Jesus our brother, strong and good 
"I," said the donkey, shaggy and brown "I carried His mother up hill and down I carried His mother to Bethlehem town" "I," said the donkey, shaggy and brown 
"I," said the cow, all white and red "I gave Him my manger for His bed I gave Him my hay to pillow His head" "I," said the cow, all white and red 
"I," said the sheep with curly horn "I gave Him my wool for His blanket warm He wore my coat on Christmas morn" "I," said the sheep with curly horn 
"I," said the dove from the rafters high "I cooed Him to sleep so that He would not cry We cooed Him to sleep, my mate and I" "I," said the dove from the rafters high 
Thus every beast by some good spell In the stable dark was glad to tell Of the gift he gave Emmanuel 
The gift he gave Emmanuel 
Praise the mountain and the rain All the gifts that still remain But the greatest gift of all And the law above all laws 
Is to love your friends and lovers To lay down your life for your brothers As you abide in peace So will your delight increase 
As the mystery of the cross Asa Lovejoy lost the toss And the fountain in the rain Where my sorrow still remains 
So I run to my friends and lovers I lay down my life for my brothers As I abide in peace So will my delight increase 
Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror From the park when Dakota ran and brought you there In the car when your mother lost her temper The catalog and the catastrophic smile 
Let the bugles play the sermon on the raid I kissed you on the face I kissed you on the playground 
Oh Father John, you cannot tell me What's right and wrong You cannot tell me I jump before I get around you Oh Father John 
Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway (Don't give up, let's go forget about yourself) 
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway Forget about yourself and all your plans 
Oh life, with your colorful surprises Eleanor, how you put one on disguises 
Oh Father John, you cannot tell me What's right and wrong You cannot tell me 
In the mortal life Far in the morning light 
We're back from Bloomington We let the runners win 
Far in the morning light We let the movies play A weekend from the holiday 
Pick it up with the band On the Ronald Reagan toll way (Don't break down, let's go... forget about yourself) 
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan toll way (If I'm wrong makes nothing right about yourself) 
Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around Forget about yourself and all your plans 
2, 3, 4 
Suppose the world was not informed by real estate or power lines? The hidden river of my life, pursued by love The whispering stone, the valley ford, the candy corn, the spirit finds Abuse has left me on my side, a single stone 
I'm a walker, I'm a dreamer Treehouse greeter, Pentacostal preacher I'm a rocker, yeah I'm a schemer Compost preacher, pioneer believer 
A small betrayal, a simple thought to shrug it off, unoccupied The precious lake, the riverbed, the rising tide The sad surprise, the day of flags, the flooding fox, the clever chime Awake my soul, awake my heart and you will find 
I'm a walker, I'm a drinker Safeway shopper, thunder egg reader I'm a biker, yeah, I'm a beaver Web-foot walker, trailblazing fever I'm a lover, yeah, I'm a reaper Subaru driver, satellite receiver I'm a trucker, yeah, I'm a chaser Pig-n-Ford rider, I'm a Nike racer

Trouble falls in my home Troubled man, troubled stone turn a mountain of lies turn a card for my life Man of Steel, Man of Heart Tame our ways, if we start To devise something more Something half ways 
Only a steel man came to recover If he had run from gold, carry over We celebrate our sense of each other We have a lot to give one another 
I took a bus to the lake Saw the monument face Yellow tides, golden eyes Red and white, red and wise Raise the flag, summer home Parted hair, part unknown If I knew what I read I'll send it half ways 
Only a real man can be a lover If he had hands to lend us all over We celebrate our sense of each other We have a lot to give one another 
Took my bags, Illinois 
Dreamt the lake took my boy Man of Steel, Man of Heart Turn your ear to my part There are things you have said Raise the boat, and raise the dead If you take us away Still we can say: 
Only a steel man can be a lover If he had hands to tremble all over We celebrate our sense of each other We have a lot to give one another 
Only a steel man can be a lover If he had hands to tremble all over We celebrate our sense of each other We have a lot to give one another 
It came upon the midnight clear That glorious sign of old Enraptured secret sign of fear In brave disguises 
Old shoes and thirty feet The prophet's sign of prophecy I resign to petty things Like angels bending on their knees 
Do you delight, do you delight, in me I laughed about it Come to me now, come to now, and bring That rapture's moment I wasn't changed, I wasn't changed, one bit Though you may doubt it I don't suppose, I don't suppose, you'd care To ask about it 
The dead of winter takes a grip And moves around us All night our labors clap and kiss Like working mothers 
Old wounds and thirty feet The clock it sounds of properties I resign to glorious things Like angels bending on their knees 
Do you delight, do you delight, in me I laughed about it Come to me now, come to now, and bring That rapture's moment I wasn't changed, I wasn't changed, one bit Though you may doubt it I don't suppose, I don't suppose, you'd care To ask about it 
I will delight, I will delight, in this Though you may doubt it Come to me now, come to me now, my kiss And ask about it 
I will delight, I will delight, in this Though you may doubt it Come to me now, come to me now, my kiss 
And the winter moves about Illinois 
When my sister picks a fight With the Alexander boy And my father locks the car by the store Still we figure out the keys And follow him once more Oh my God, we see it on the floor The woman on the bed The ankle brace she wore Stones and sled It could have been some other The mind that knows itself Has a mind to serve the other But we run back, scratching at the door Scratching at the door 
If I'm hiding in the sleeves of my coat When my father runs undressed He's pointing at my throat And my brother has fit in the snow And the traffic stops for miles We take him by the elbow Oh my God, the shuffling and the floor A mind that knows itself Is a mind that knows much more So we run back, scrambling for cover The mind that knows itself Has a mind to kill the other (Oh my God, no one came to our side To carry us away from danger) 
Oh my God He left us now for dead He left us now for dead 
The only thing that keeps me from driving this carHalf-light, jack knife into the canyon at nightSigns and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skullSlain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all 
Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where theyâ..re found 
In a veil of great surprises; I wonder did you love me at all? 
The only thing that keeps me from cutting my armCross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after darkSigns and wonders: water stain writing the wall
Danielâ..s message; blood of the moon on us all 
Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I knowIn a veil of great disguises; how do I live with your ghost? 
Should I tear my eyes out now?Everything I see returns to you somehowShould I tear my heart out now?Everything I feel returns to you somehowI want to save you from your sorrow 
The only reason why I continue at allFaith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumbSigns and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, Godâ..
s grace, nothing else left to impart 
Do I care if I survive this, bury the dead where theyâ..

Everything is lost, uh-oh But I know that you can take it to the Lord Everything you are, uh-oh Isn't all that you can gather for yourself 
Do you love a lot? Uh-oh Is it love that you just kiss to everyone? Is your loving lost? Uh-oh Is it strange that you perpetuate yourself? (All that he has given to the world Is the joy that he will carry to the door) 
All that he has given to the world All that he has given to the world (Uh-oh, is it strange that you perpetuate yourself?) All that he has given to the world (For what it costs, uh-oh) All that he has given to the world (Everything is lost, uh-oh) All that he has given to the world (Is the joy that he will carry to the door) All that he has given to the world (Still I know that you can take it to the war) 
All things past in the pick-up 
Found my brother's badge Abraham is live and well in the pick-up And his wife casts no more spells In the pick-up 
Found myself in the pick-up Seatbelt on my lap And my sister with her braids In the pick-up Kissed my mother on the face In the pick-up Clapping with the human race In the pick-up 
Thinking outrageously I write in cursive 
I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers I see my own breath on the face of the door 
Oh I am not quite sleeping Oh I am fast in bed There on the wall in the bedroom creeping I see a wasp with her wings outstretched 
North of Savanna we swim in the palisades I come out wearing my brother's red hat There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times He runs washing his face in his hands 
Oh how I meant to tease him Oh how I meant no harm Touching his back with my hand I kiss him I see the wasp on the length of my arm 
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu-Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu-Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelu-trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love. Palisades! Palisades! Palisades I can wait. I can wait. 
Lamb of God, we sound the horn. 
Hallelujah! 
To us your ghost is born. Hallelu-
I can't explain the state that I'm in The state of my heart, he was my best friend Into the car, from the back seat Oh admiration in falling asleep All of my powers, day after day I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed Deep in the tower, the prairies below I can tell you, the telling gets old Terrible sting and terrible storm I can tell you the day we were born My friend is gone, he ran away I can tell you, I love him each day Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged I can tell you I love him each day Terrible sting, terrible storm I can tell you... 
Give me a name Holding the flame Burning a megaphone What are you waiting for? An open door? 
Show me your friends Slamming at raves I'll be the reservoir What are you waiting? March through the door In the tower above the earth, 
There is a view that reaches far Where we see the universe, I see the fire, I see the end. 
Seven miles above the earth, There is Emmanuel of mothers. With his sword, with his robe, He comes dividing man from brothers. 
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel. In the powers of the earth, we wait until it rips and rips. In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel. Oh my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us. 
Still I go to the deepest grave, Where I go to sleep alone 
We wait in our beds Tight under the sheets Just peeking our heads We've waited for weeks I can't go to sleep I tried counting sheep It's coming so soon The sleigh in moon 
I'm holding my breath I can't keep it yet No, we won't forget We know that we're blessed We know that we're blessed We know that we're blessed [Part I: "The Great Frontier"]

Then there came a word of what he should accomplish on the day Then Peter spoke, to make of them a tabernacle place A cloud appeared in glory as an accolade They fell on the ground A voice arrived, the voice of God The face of God covered in a cloud 
What he said to them, the voice of God, the most beloved son Consider what he says to you, consider what's to come The prophecy was put to death, was put to death And so will the son And keep your word, disguise the vision Till the time has come

I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes 
The Upper Peninsula and the television news I've seen my wife at the K-Mart In strange ideas we live apart 
I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car The window is broken out and the interstate is far I drove all night to find my child In strange ideas he's been revived 
In strange ideas, in stranger times I've no idea what's right sometimes I lost my mind, I lost my life I lost my job, I lost my wife 
If you happen to be educated Time it marches on, oh time it marches on. In the end there is a sacred show delivers every song, delivers every song. 
Mourning steps and mourning gallivants And mourning never shows, no mourning never slows. If the avatar reminds that it will never stand at all, will never stand as tall. 
Since the water made it, most to sail it, made it most to song, it made it most to song. For the politics are not political for what they stand, For not what they demand. Every senator and diplomat combines her certain part, A matter for the heart. Save yourself from recognition. selfless and quite song To better get along. 
(We love you. We Chose to. We made to. We love you.) 
If we concentrate and pull resources to the highest poll, To beat the highest pull, too. Ever will we conquer grief and find it faster to resolve the dead, to be absolved and fed, to restore. If the advantageous reprimand misgivings, We wont grow. We will not ever know. We will not! (Lift my life in healthy places!) 
I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S! Ring the bell and call or write us I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S! Can you call the Captain Clitus? Logan, Grant, and Ronald Reagan In the grave with Xylophagan Do you know the ghost community? Sound the horn, address the city 
(Who will save it? Dedicate it? Who will praise it? Commemorate it for you?) 
We are awakened with the axe Night of the Living Dead at last They have begun to shake the dirt Wiping their shoulders from the earth I know, I know the nations past I know, I know they rust at last They tremble with the nervous thought Of having been, at last, forgot 
I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S! Ring the bell and call or write us I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S! Can you call the Captain Clitus? B-U-D-A! Caledonia! S-E-C-O-R! Magnolia! B-I-R-D-S! And Kankakee! 
Evansville and Parker City 
Speaking their names, they shake the flag Waking the earth, it lifts and lags We see a thousand rooms to rest Helping us taste the bite of death I know, I know my time has passed I'm not so young, I'm not so fast I tremble with the nervous thought Of having been, at last, forgot 
I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S! Ring the bell and call or write us I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S! Can you call the Captain Clitus? Comer and Potato Peelers! G-R-E-E-N Ridge! Reeders M-C-V-E-Y! And Horace! E-N-O-S! Start the chorus 
Corn and farms and tombs in Lemmon Sailor Springs and all things feminine Centerville and Old Metropolis Shawneetown, you trade and topple us I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S! Hold your tongue and don't divide us I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S! Land of God, you hold and guide us 
I'd swim across Lake Michigan I'd sell my shoes I'd give my body to be back again In the rest of the room 
To be alone with you To be alone with you To be alone with you To be alone with you 
You gave your body to the lonely They took your clothes You gave up a wife and a family You gave your ghost 
To be alone with me To be alone with me To be alone with me You went up on a tree 
To be alone with me you went up on a tree I've never known a man who loved me 
Tonya Harding, my star Well this world is a cold one But it takes one to know one And God only knows what you are 
Just some Portland white trash You confronted your sorrow Like there was no tomorrow While the rest of the world only laughed 
Triple axel on high A delightful disaster You jumped farther and faster You were always so full of surprises 
Are your laces untied? What's the frown on your face for? And just what are the skates for now? Tell me which is your good side? 
Are you lonely at night? Do you miss all the glory And the mythical story Of the Olympian life? 
Yamaguchi in red She had high rise and roses And red-carpet poses And her outfit was splendid 
Nancy Kerrigan's charm Well she took quite a beating So you're not above cheating Can you blame her for crying? 
Tonya, you were the brightest Yeah you rose from the ashes And survived all the crashes Wiping the blood from your white tights 
Has the world had its fun? Yeah they'll make such a hassle And they'll build you a castle Then destroy it when they're done 
Tonya Harding, my friend Well this world is a bitch, girl Don't end up in a ditch, girl I'll be watching you close to the end 
So fight on as you are My American princess May God bless you with incense 
You're my shining American star 
You're my shining American star You're my shining American star

Up on the housetop reindeer pause Out jumps good old Santa Claus Down through the chimney with lots of toys All for the little ones, Christmas joys Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go? Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go? 
First comes the stocking of little Nell Oh, dear Santa fill it well Give her a dolly that laughs and cries One that can open and shut its eyes Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go? Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go? 
Next comes the stocking of little Will Oh, just see what a glorious fill Here is a hammer and lots of tacks Whistle, and ball, and a set of jacks Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go? Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go? 
Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead Anyone particular, everyone fed I'm in the doorstop holding it down Waiting for a miracle, waiting for a crowd 
One of the scenario, thinking up a cause Anyone particular, any old cause Hands on the counter, feet on the floor Moving to the kitchen and you get your passport 
Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead Down through the chimney is what the man said 
Up on the housetop reindeer pause Out jumps good old Santa Claus Down through the chimney with lots of toys All for the little ones, Christmas joys Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go? Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go? 
Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead Down through the chimney is what the man said 
What are you now? Castrated by your son The odd spring scattered on the deep From Aphrodesia 
You sexless fraud From chaos choreographed Defiled us in a fit of rage The earth will find its way 
Violent storm, from mysterious vengeance lies Born from incest, as the evidence flipped its eyes 
Cross me with your wildness Snake-eyed warrior's knife 
Aquarius The scorpion Your venom kiss My guardian I trust your touch I trust your cries Render the knife Cut off my kind 
My, you, they, we, us My, you, they, we, us My, you, they, we, us My, you, they, we, us For the love of God In the shade of Ursa Major For the life of me, I Can't account for human nature 
For your information I'm not one for controversy So I ask forgiveness now Lord, reveal Yourself in mercy 
Call off all emergency and Look at things the way I see them For the beauty of the Earth It shows us wisdom, love, and rebirth 
I wanna love You, I wanna love You Until the Earth runs through it I wanna love You, I wanna love You And I'm definitely gonna do it 
For the love of mercy In the face of all this danger For the most of all my life I feel as if I were a stranger 
And all the consequences From the throes of our persuasion Lord, I ask for patience now Call off all of Your invasion 
There is beauty where I see it Everywhere that I can feel it I am on the verge of sorrow Tell me, Lord, which road to follow 
I wanna love You, I wanna love You Until the Earth runs through it I wanna love You, I wanna love You And I'm definitely gonna do it 
I wanna love You, I wanna love You Until the Earth runs through it I wanna love You, I wanna love You And I'm definitely gonna do it Oh no There I go twisting your arm Oracle ghost Love me completely in song Methodist summer camp You show me yours, show you mine Sensitive thunderclap Slip beneath sleeping bag spine Run, radiator, run Redheaded, horny-eyed friend Run Taurobolium Blood that ran off from the stem 
Go slow Pandemos, fill of me Cherokee jeep in the yard Pull off your running shoes Sweet Callipygian, guardian goddess My guard 
Half shell Half undressed lover of mine Born Aphrogenia Jealousy drink of your wine 
Crazed nymphomania Touch me if touching's no sin Heart shaped Anemone felt from within 
Don't go Pandemos, fill of me I never meant to do harm to you, to love Don't go Pandemos, fill of me I never meant to do harm to you, to love 
Vesuvius, I am here You are all I have Fire of fire, I'm insecure For it has all been made to plan 
Though I know I will fail I cannot be made to laugh For in life as in death I'd rather be burned than be living in debt 
Vesuvius, are you ghost? Or the symbols of light? Or of fantasy host? In your breast I carry the form The heart of the earth and the weapons of warmth 
Vesuvius, the tragic oath For you have destroyed the elegant smoke Oracle, I fought him at last They were the feast of a permanent blast 
Vesuvius, oh be kind It hasn't occurred, no it hasn't been said Sufjan, follow the path It leads to an article of eminent death 
Sufjan, follow your heart Follow the flame, or fall on the floor Sufjan, the panic inside The murdering ghost that you cannot ignore 
Vesuvius, fire of fire Follow me now, as I favor the host 
Vesuvius, fire of fire Follow me now, as I favor the ghost 
Follow me now, or follow me down Why does it have to be so hard? 
I don't wanna be your personal Jesus I don't wanna live inside of that flame In a way I wanna be my own believer I don't wanna play your video game I don't wanna be the center of the universe I don't wanna be a part of that shame In a way I wanna be my own redeemer I don't wanna play your video game 
I don't care if everybody else is into it I don't care if it's a popular refrain I don't wanna be a puppet in a theater I don't wanna play your video game You don't wanna be the one who has to pay for it You don't wanna be the one who has to changeAll you want is what the resumÃƒÂ© tells you I don't wanna play your video game

I don't wanna love you if won't receive it I don't wanna save the world that way I don't wanna be your personal Jesus I don't wanna play your video game I don't wanna put the devil on a pedestal I don't wanna put the saints in chains I just wanna make my life a little easier I don't wanna play your video game 
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play (I don't wanna play) I don't wanna play your video game (I just wanna go away) I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play (I don't wanna play) I don't wanna play your video game (I just wanna go away) I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play (I don't wanna play) I don't wanna play your video game (I just wanna go away) I don't wanna play, I don't wanna play (I don't wanna play) I don't wanna play your video game 
I don't wanna be your Julius Caesar I don't want it to go down that way 
But in a way you gotta follow the procedure So go ahead and play your video game

I have loved you for the last time Is it a video? Is it a video? I have touched you for the last time Is it a video? Is it a video? 
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms Is it a video? Is it a video? For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms Is it a video? Is it a video? Is it a video?

I always knew you In your mothers arms I have called your name I've an idea Placed in your mind To be a better man I've made a crown for you Put it in your room And when the bride groom comes There will be noise There will be glad And a perfect bed 
And when you write a poem I know the words, I know the sounds Before you write it down When you wear your clothes I wear them too, I wear your shoes And the jacket too I always knew you In your mothers arms I have called you son I've made amends Between father and son Or if you haven't one 
Rest in my arms Sleep in my bed 
There's a design To what I did and said 
I always knew you In your mothers arms I have called your name I have an idea 
Placed in your mind To be a better man I've made a crown for you Put it in your room 
And when the bride groom comes There will be noise There will be glad And a perfect bed 
And when you write a poem I know the words I know the sounds Before you write it down 
Only wear your clothes I wear them too I wear your shoes And your jacket too 
I always knew you In your mothers arms I have called you son I've made amends 
Between father and son Or if you haven't one Rest in my arms Sleep in my bed 
There is a design To what I did and said 
As if you know the story of Wallowa Lake Leviathan first hid in the deep where her children sleep She kept them hidden from the plagueBut have you heard the story of my motherÃ¢Â€Â™s fate? She left us in Detroit in the rain with a pillowcase Fortune for the paperweight 
We followed her to Joseph, near the Indian raid She wept among the weeds, hide and seek, for the fallen chief Spathiphyllum on his grave And like the cedar waxwing, she was drunk all day We put her in the sheet, little wreath, candles on the crate As the monster showed its face 
As she waits for her children in the shade Demogorgon or demigod the ghost parade No oblation will bring her back to our place 
She stayed within the deep end of Wallowa Lake The undertow refrained with the flame of a feathered snake Charybdis in its shallow grave She gave us one last feature, the fullness of her faceIn the shade of "Hin-mah-too-yahÃ¢Â€Â¦" (Red Napoleon) As the demon took her place 
As we wait for the waters to reside Her remarkable stoicism and her pride When the dragon submerged we knew she had died 
Mad he was, inward Break her barn, back door 
When the water rushed and poured Took the relatives she stored So the Father Ghost and Lord Took the revelation stored 
It's a waste of money spent and given It's a waste of what was, when forgiven And your children burn their backs in bed It's a waste of what your kids won't have 
When the man took his gun Put it on your youngest one Took the curtains off the glass Took the virgin for what she has 
It's a waste of money spent and given It's a waste of what was, when forgiven And your children burn their backs in bed It's a waste of what your kids won't have 
It's a waste of what your kids won't have It's a waste of what your kids won't have 
We are a servant, we have a song 
The side of a beehive, a tabernacle choir We are the sound working in wars The bishop is gone to the acolyte shores 
We save our Bibles, we pull our sleeves The word is a guard and the guard is a cleave We are the right, we are the stay The accolade's gone, we are what you say 
We have no language, we have no chore The side of a beehive, the bride is a whore We are a spite, we are at bay The spirit is life, we are what you say 
We have a sermon, we have a song The bishop is easy, the bishop is wrong The spirit is right, the spirit will say We are a light, we are what you say 
1, 2, 3, 4 Haul out the holly Put up the tree before my spirit falls again Fill up the stocking I may be rushing things, but deck the halls again now 
For we need a little Christmas, right this very minute Candles in the window, carols at the spinet Yes, we need a little Christmas, right this very minute It hasn't snowed a single flurry, Santa dear, we're in a hurry 
So climb down the chimney Turn on the brightest string of lights I've ever seen Slice up the fruitcake It's time we hung some tinsel on that evergreen bough 
For I've grown a little leaner, grown a little colder Grown a little sadder, grown a little older And I need a little angel sitting on my shoulder Need a little Christmas now 
For we need a little music, need a little laughter Need a little singing ringing through the rafter And we need a little snappy happy ever after Need a little Christmas now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 
We three kings of Orient are Bearing gifts we travel afar Field and fountain, moor and mountain Following yonder star 
O Star of wonder, star of night Star with royal beauty bright Westward leading, still proceeding Guide us to thy Perfect Light 
Glorious now behold Him arise King and God and Sacrifice Alleluia, Alleluia Earth to heav'n replies 
O Star of wonder, star of night Star with royal beauty bright Westward leading, still proceeding Guide us to thy perfect light 
We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 
Now bring us a figgy pudding Now bring us a figgy pudding Now bring us a figgy pudding and a cup of good cheer 
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 
We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
